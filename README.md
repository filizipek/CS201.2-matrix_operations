# Matrix Operations Program

## Overview

This C++ program is designed to perform various matrix operations. It provides a menu-driven interface that allows users to choose operations such as addition, multiplication, power, and transpose on matrices. The program supports matrices of different dimensions and validates input to ensure the correct execution of operations.

## Features

1. **Menu-Driven Interface:**
   - Users can choose from the following matrix operations:
     - Addition
     - Multiplication
     - Power
     - Transpose
     - Exit

2. **Matrix Addition:**
   - Performs addition operation on two matrices with the same dimensions.

3. **Matrix Multiplication:**
   - Performs multiplication operation on two matrices, where the number of columns in the first matrix is equal to the number of rows in the second matrix.

4. **Matrix Power:**
   - Calculates the power of a square matrix. The user is prompted to enter the desired power.

5. **Matrix Transpose:**
   - Calculates the transpose of a matrix.

6. **Input Validation:**
   - Validates input dimensions and matrix compatibility for addition and multiplication operations.

## Usage Instructions

1. **Compile and Run:**
   - Compile the program using a C++ compiler.
   - Run the executable to start the program.

2. **Menu Selection:**
   - Choose a matrix operation from the provided menu options.

3. **Matrix Input:**
   - Enter the dimensions of matrices and the matrix elements as prompted.

4. **Results:**
   - View the results of the chosen matrix operation.

5. **Exit:**
   - Choose option 5 to exit the program.

## Matrix Operation Details

### 1. Matrix Addition (Choice 1)
   - Matrices must have the same dimensions for addition.

### 2. Matrix Multiplication (Choice 2)
   - Number of columns in the first matrix must be equal to the number of rows in the second matrix for multiplication.

### 3. Matrix Power (Choice 3)
   - Calculates the power of a square matrix.

### 4. Matrix Transpose (Choice 4)
   - Calculates the transpose of a matrix.

## Example Usage

1. **Addition:**
   - Input: Two matrices with the same dimensions.
   - Output: Result of matrix addition.

2. **Multiplication:**
   - Input: Two matrices with compatible dimensions.
   - Output: Result of matrix multiplication.

3. **Power:**
   - Input: A square matrix and the desired power.
   - Output: Result of matrix raised to the specified power.

4. **Transpose:**
   - Input: A matrix.
   - Output: Transpose of the matrix.

## Notes

- Ensure the input matrices meet the requirements for the selected operation.
- Follow on-screen prompts for entering matrix elements and dimensions.
